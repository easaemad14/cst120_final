This is my final project for CST 120, Embedded C.

For this project, I am using two push buttons: one to represent a dot, and the other a dash.
These are then encoded to be displayed on a seven segment LED.

Included in this file, there should be two images (the seven segment layout and the binary tree
for morse code) which I used, and referrenced, in my code. The code should be sufficiently
commented. 

There were some issues when doing this project, most of which had to do with Arduino's IDE,
since it is geared more for beginners. Due to this fact, there is some functionality (and
style) that I would have preferred to behave differently, but took the easiest route when
completing.

I will upload a video to YouTube, for quick reference when I do my presentation on my project
tomorrow. This will keep me from having to drag around my UNO and trying to preserve the state
of the build.
